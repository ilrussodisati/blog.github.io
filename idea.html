    <h1 class="text">How the idea was born</h1>
    <img src="images/ideapage_001.png" ; class="text_002">
    <p class="text_001">The idea came from an English task where you had to write a blog about a fictional or famous
        person. So having
        the computer skills in HTML and CSS, I decided to create a web page where to write this blog. The blog talks
        about a person who really exists, a footballer of the Serie A and the Nigerian national team.</p>


    <h1 class="text_003">How I worked to the project</h1>

    <img src="images/java_001.png" ; class="text_005">

    <p class="text_004">I started from zero following tutorial on YouTube and trying something new about coding. I tryed
        with Java and Phyton, very hard but not really bad. After trying these two, I decided to try coding in C/C++,
        which is very difficult for me without having specifically studied the language, so I let it go. After a few
        days, I decided to learn to code in HTML, a language for programming websites.</p>

    <h2 class="text_007">My first Java code line</h2>

    <p class="text_006">But it was also necessary to know
        how to code in CSS, a language for programming the style for HTML. Starting to watch tutorials seemed difficult,
        but all in all at my levels of programming skills, so I started writing a few lines of code and... Here we are,
        with this "beautiful" website made 100% by me, open-source images (because I did not want to do the images) and
        a great desire to do.</p>

    <h1 class="text_008">What about the future of the page?</h1>

    <p class="text_009">This website will be constantly updated by uploading my projects related to HTML and CSS,
        perhaps with some introductory tutorial to web coding.</p>
